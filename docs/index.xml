      <description>It is photography that has rendered it possible to express myself in what I consider to be the most fitting way. It allows me to do document my point of view on the diversity of events that surround me. Surely, it combines the conditions for capturing the passages in time and space while contributing to the translation of the narratives of the mind.
I am in search of unfamiliar challenges to learn to overcome them and by doing so I wish to drive my capacities to their absolute limit.</description>
